# Loss functions

## Selecting a loss

The training loss is a Hydra config group. The default is set in
`icenet_mp/config/base.yaml` (`loss: huber`) and can be overridden on any command
line:

```bash
imp train --config-name <config> loss=mse
imp train --config-name <config> loss=amse loss.mode=hybrid loss.spectral_weight=0.1
```

Each option corresponds to a file in `icenet_mp/config/loss/`, whose header comments
carry the full parameter documentation; this page summarises how to choose between
them.

## Supported losses

| `loss=` | what it is | pros | cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| `huber` (default) | quadratic below `delta`, linear above | smooth near zero, robust to outliers, loss stays in target units above `delta` | needs `delta` chosen; below `delta` it inherits MSE's blur incentive (see AMSE) |
| `mse` | squared residual | smooth everywhere; strong gradient on large errors | outlier-sensitive; strongest amplitude-damping (blur) incentive |
| `mae` | absolute residual | fully outlier-robust; constant gradient | non-smooth at zero; weak signal on small errors |
| `rmse` | `sqrt(MSE + eps)` | interpretable in target units | same optimum as MSE; gradient rescaled by the running loss value |
| `smooth_l1` | Huber variant with `beta` transition | as Huber; PyTorch-native parameterisation | as Huber |
| `weighted_mse` / `weighted_l1` / `weighted_bce` | elementwise `sample_weights` × MSE / L1 / BCE-with-logits | spatial weighting (e.g. emphasise the ice edge or active cells) | weights must be supplied and justified; BCE assumes a [0, 1] classification framing |
| `uncertainty_weighted` | Huber weighted by inverse observational variance | directly uses SSMIS target uncertainty and reduces the influence of less-certain observations | currently supports a single predicted target variable and requires the configured uncertainty variable in the target dataset |
| `amse` | spectral anti-blur loss (Subich et al. 2025, arXiv:2501.19374, flat-grid adaptation) | removes the "double penalty": matching the target's power spectrum per scale band is optimal at any coherence, so partially-predictable fine scales are no longer rewarded for being damped | more expensive than pointwise losses (FFT per step); `hybrid` mode introduces `spectral_weight` to calibrate |

## Using SIC observation uncertainty

Directly downloaded SSMIS datasets include `total_standard_uncertainty`, which is
rescaled to a fraction during ingestion. `loss=uncertainty_weighted` reads that
variable for the same dates as the forecast target and computes a Huber loss weighted
by `sigma^-power` (inverse variance when `power=2`). The weighted mean is normalised by
the sum of weights. A common positive rescaling of valid uncertainties therefore does
not change the objective unless it moves values across the configured clipping or
validity thresholds.

```bash
imp train --config-name <config> loss=uncertainty_weighted
```

The default configuration uses `power=2`, clips very small valid uncertainties at
`0.01`, and excludes non-finite, non-positive, or sentinel-like values above `1.0`.
If every uncertainty value in a batch is invalid, the loss falls back to ordinary
Huber loss for that batch rather than producing `NaN`.

The loss receives uncertainty through a separate `target_uncertainty` batch field.
This does not add a new model-input channel or metric; any uncertainty already present
among a dataset group's ordinary input variables is unchanged. At present this loss
supports exactly one predicted target variable, which matches the standard SIC
configuration.

## Why an anti-blur loss exists (the double penalty, in two sentences)

For any squared-error-type loss, the loss-optimal amplitude of a spatial scale the
model cannot predict perfectly equals its coherence with the target — at 50 %
coherence the optimal move is to halve that scale's amplitude. Spatial blur is
therefore the *optimum* of pointwise training, not a failure of it; AMSE modifies the
per-scale decomposition so that preserving the target's spectrum is optimal instead
(full derivation in the header of `icenet_mp/losses/amse_loss.py`).

### AMSE options

* `loss.mode=hybrid` (default): standard Huber plus `spectral_weight` × the AMSE
  excess. At `spectral_weight=0` this is exactly the Huber control. Calibrate
  `spectral_weight` so the spectral term carries ~10 % of the total loss at
  initialisation (the untrained model's Huber/excess ratio differs per architecture).
* `loss.mode=pure`: the AMSE objective alone (no `spectral_weight`).
* `loss.wavenumber_weight=fastnet` (default off): re-weights the spectral penalty
  toward fine scales by `max(N_k * k^sqrt(3), 1)` (FastNet, arXiv:2509.17601) at
  unchanged total, moving the penalty onto ice-edge scales.
* `loss.static_ref_path=<path.npy>` (default off): subtracts a static reference field
  from both prediction and target before the spectral terms, so static
  climatological structure does not dilute the anti-blur signal.

Both optional flags are bit-for-bit inert when off.
