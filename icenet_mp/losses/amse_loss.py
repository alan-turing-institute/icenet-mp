"""Adjusted-MSE (AMSE) spectral anti-blur loss on a flat grid.

Adaptation of the spherical-harmonic AMSE loss of Subich et al. (2025),
"Fixing the Double Penalty in Data-Driven Weather Forecasting Through a
Modified Spherical Harmonic Loss Function" (arXiv:2501.19374), to the flat
equal-area EASE2 grids used by icenet-mp. Independent reimplementation of the
published formula; reference implementation (spherical, JAX) at
https://github.com/csubich/graphcast (branch ``amse``).

Pointwise squared-error losses reward damping the amplitude of scales the
model cannot predict exactly (the "double penalty"): per scale group, the
MSE-optimal amplitude ratio equals the coherence with the target, so partially
predictable fine scales are systematically blurred. AMSE removes this
incentive. Writing per scale group k the powers P_k(x), P_k(y) and coherence
Coh_k(x, y) of prediction x and target y,

    MSE(x, y)  = sum_k [ (sqrt(P_k(x)) - sqrt(P_k(y)))^2
                         + 2 * sqrt(P_k(x) * P_k(y)) * (1 - Coh_k(x, y)) ]
    AMSE(x, y) = sum_k [ (sqrt(P_k(x)) - sqrt(P_k(y)))^2
                         + 2 * max(P_k(x), P_k(y)) * (1 - Coh_k(x, y)) ]

so under AMSE the decorrelation penalty can no longer be reduced by shrinking
the predicted amplitude, and the amplitude optimum at any fixed coherence is
P_k(x) = P_k(y): the target's power spectrum is preserved scale by scale.

On the flat grid the orthonormal decomposition is the 2D DFT and the scale
groups are annular bins of the isotropic wavenumber |k| = sqrt(kx^2 + ky^2);
Parseval's identity makes the group decomposition of MSE exact, which is the
only property the construction needs (Subich et al., Sec. 2.2 and 4.2).

Scope: designed and tested for spatial-field predictions (single-stage
encode-process-decode). Using this loss with models whose training loss lives
in a different space (e.g. DDPM v-space) is untested.

    """Adjusted-MSE (anti-double-penalty) spectral loss on a flat grid.

    Two modes:

    - ``"hybrid"`` (default): the repo's standard Huber loss plus
      ``spectral_weight`` times the AMSE *excess*
      ``sum_k 2 * (max(P_k(x), P_k(y)) - sqrt(P_k(x) * P_k(y))) * (1 - Coh_k)``,
      which is >= 0, zero iff per-bin spectra match or coherence is perfect,
      and reduces to the unmodified Huber control at ``spectral_weight=0``.
    - ``"pure"``: the AMSE formula itself (per-bin amplitude + decorrelation
      terms plus a direct DC term), averaged over fields.

    Both modes sum the annular bins UNWEIGHTED by default, as in the Subich
    reference. ``wavenumber_weight="fastnet"`` instead upweights each bin by
    ``gamma_k = max(N_k * k**sqrt(3), 1)`` (FastNet, arXiv:2509.17601), which
    moves the penalty from the large scales that dominate a steep sea-ice
    spectrum onto the fine scales where the ice edge lives; the total is held
    fixed so ``spectral_weight`` stays comparable across the two settings (see
    ``_weight_bins``). Default OFF: unset, the loss is bit-for-bit unchanged.

    Numerical guards follow the reference implementation: ``eps`` inside the
    geometric-mean square root (the coherence denominator is singular for a
    zero field), coherence clamped at 1 from above (Cauchy-Schwarz can be
    violated by the eps), the mean/DC component handled as a direct squared
    difference (catastrophic cancellation), and all spectral arithmetic in
    float32.

        With ``wavenumber_weight="none"`` the input is returned untouched, so
        the default path is bit-for-bit the unweighted Subich sum.

        With ``"fastnet"`` each bin is multiplied by
        ``gamma_k = max(N_k * k**sqrt(3), 1)`` and the result is divided by a
        DETACHED scalar chosen so the batch total is unchanged:

            sum_(i,k) gamma_k * c_ik / Z == sum_(i,k) c_ik,
            Z = sum_(i,k) gamma_k * c_ik / sum_(i,k) c_ik.

        Rationale: raw gamma_k grows like k**2.7 (N_k ~ 2*pi*k), spanning ~7
        orders of magnitude across the bins of a 432x432 grid, so the raw
        weighted sum would change the SCALE of the spectral term by orders of
        magnitude. That silently rescales the effective learning rate of the
        spectral branch and makes ``spectral_weight`` mean something different
        from its value in the unweighted arm - which would confound the
        factorial comparison the flag exists to serve. Normalising gamma to
        mean 1 over the active bins does NOT fix this: gamma is strongly
        anti-correlated with where the penalty sits (the penalty is concentrated
        at low |k| where gamma is smallest), so the total would still move by a
        large factor. Preserving the total makes the change purely a
        REDISTRIBUTION of the penalty across scales - exactly the intended
        intervention - and keeps the arm trainable at the unweighted arm's lr.
        Z is detached, so gradients are those of a fixed per-bin reweighting
        (a constant rescale of an ordinary weighted sum), not of a ratio.

        The DC term is deliberately NOT weighted. It is not an annulus (the DC
        mode carries binning weight 0 and never reaches a bin), and the FastNet
        formula itself assigns it gamma_0 = max(0 * 0**sqrt(3), 1) = 1; it is
        the domain-mean bias, which must keep full weight.
