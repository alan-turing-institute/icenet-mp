    Non-finite values and an optional finite missing-date sentinel are replaced with

    trainable 1x1 adapter maps the augmented input back to the original channel count so
    the existing CNN architecture and latent-space contract remain unchanged.

    During training, complete time slices can also be dropped at random. Since
    ``BaseEncoder.rollout`` folds batch and time together before calling ``forward``,
    this conditioning dropout is sampled independently for each history time slice.
