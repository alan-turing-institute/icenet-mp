"""Vision Transformer implementation.

Description:
    Vision Transformer (ViT) model for sea ice forecasting that predicts future sea ice
    concentration from meteorological data. Takes multi-channel input images, converts
    them to patch embeddings, processes through transformer encoder blocks, and outputs
    spatially-resolved predictions for specified forecast horizons.
